## PCLI
As you have seen in other sections on how to generate **Action**/**Model**/**Middleware**/**Request** through PCLI from root. We can also generate classes apart from the above options.
#### Class
```
php pcli create class Sample
```
It will create class at `/app/Sample.php` with content
```php
<?php
namespace App;

class Sample
{
    
}
```
To create class file at different location, you can do
```
php pcli create class Helpers.Sample
```
The path we are passing is seprated by dot `.` and it will create class at `/App/Helpers/Sample.php` with content
```php
<?php
namespace App\Helpers;

class Sample
{
    
}
```
#### Trait
Traits can also be generated by command
```
php pcli create trait Sample
```
It will create class at `app/Traits/Sample.php` with content
```php
<?php
namespace App\Traits;

trait Sample
{
    
}
```
**Note:** trait files will only be created in `app/Traits/` directory with cli run.
#### Multi Level Directory File
We can also go to multi level paths for generating **class**/**trait**/**action**/**model**/**request**/**middleware** file.
```
php pcli create action User.Details
```
It will create file at `app/Actions/User/Details.php` with content
```php
<?php

namespace App\Actions\User;

use PHPattern\Action;

class Details extends Action
{
    
}
```
Same applies to other cli action types for generating files and path given must be separated by dot `.`
```
php pcli create class App.User.Details
php pcli create trait User.Details
php pcli create action User.Details
php pcli create model User.Details
php pcli create request User.Details
php pcli create middleware User.Details
```
